# Customer segmentation via unsupervised learning

Data source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers#

The data lists the annual spend of various customers of a wholesale distributor. 
The goal of this project is to identify the different customer segments and understand the variations among the different 
groups. This will help the distributor meet their customer needs better.

The goal is achieved by identifying the key dimensions through Pricipal Component Analysis (PCA) that maximize the variance among the different features. 
Following this, k-means clustering algorithm is used identify the unique segments.
